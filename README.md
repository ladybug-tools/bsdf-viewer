# BSDF Viewer

BSDF viewer is a web-based BSDF parser and viewer written in JavaScript. The project is
inspired by [Andy McNeil's BSDF viewer](https://www.radiance-online.org/download-install/third-party-utilities/bsdf-viewer).

The goal of the project is to address the current issues with installation and operating
system compatibility by developing a web-based viewer for BSDF files that runs in every
modern browser.

And if you are wondering what BSDF stands for. It stands for [Bidirectional Scattering Distribution Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_scattering_distribution_function).
If you are dead serious to learn about BSDFs
and their use in [Radiance](https://www.radiance-online.org/) then see
[this slides](https://www.radiance-online.org/community/workshops/2019-new-york-ny/presentations/day1/20190821_BSDF_and_Matrix_Tutorial_final.pdf) from the BSDF workshop.

## Roadmap

The project is a work in progress and currently does not support TensorTree BSDFs. The
parser for TensorTree files has been already implemented but there is no viewer!

## Credits

The BSDF viewer is using [D3js](https://github.com/d3/) for interactive visualization.

The legend is modified from [this example](http://bl.ocks.org/syntagmatic/e8ccca52559796be775553b467593a9f).

So many thanks to:

- Greg Ward for Radiance, for answering all my stupid questions about BSDF and
  providing sample code and related documents.
- Andy McNeil for all the above except for not creating Radiance and plus his genBSDF
  tutorial. And if that was not enough now he has contributed code to the viewer!
- David Geisler-Moroder for the comprehensive BSDF workshop, providing the conversion
  factors for Klems BSDF and answering my random BSDF questions.
- Rob Guglielmetti for testing and providing feedback and answering my questions.
- Taoning Wang for testing the interface and reporting the bug with Klems parser.
- Eleanor Lee for making BSDFs look easy to understand during her presentations.
- Sarith Subramaniam for helping with the initial push to write the viewer and providing
  support for using genBSDF.
- [Let me know if you are missing from the list! Thanks.]
